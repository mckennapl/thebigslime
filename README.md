# THE BIG SLIME FM

Welcome to THE BIG SLIME. Dutton's ~~only~~ greatest radio station broadcasting straight from a basement via a $9 FM transmitter module and soldered-on piece of wire acting as an antenna connected to an old Debian box.

This repo houses the `liquidsoap` playlists that I would be super sad if I lost. Comprised entirely of music that I love to listen to and I'm trying to get my 4 year old into.
